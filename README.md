# HOW TO RUN IT:

1. Unzip the files and put the project2 folder and Makefile onto your Desktop.
2. Makefile is not the same directory of project2.
3. Open up git and type: javac project2/*.java to compile
4. Then type the following command after everything has compiled:

`java project2/distance_vector_routing server -t project2/test.txt -i 10`

where test.txt is the name of your topology file and 10 is the update interval number`
